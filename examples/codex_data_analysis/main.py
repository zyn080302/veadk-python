"""A `runtime="codex"` analyst that writes, runs and *debugs* its own script.

This is the task the codex runtime exists for. The agent is handed a 2 400-row
warehouse extract with realistic defects buried in it — blank revenue cells,
prices carrying thousands separators, a second date format, three spellings of
one region — none of them in the first 200 rows and none of them mentioned in
the prompt. The file is far too big to eyeball, so the agent has to write an
analysis script, run it, read the traceback, fix it, and run it again until the
numbers come out. On ``runtime="adk"`` the model can only *emit* a script and
hope; here it executes one inside an OS sandbox and sees what happened.

What the example demonstrates:

- **Path-passing, not payload-passing.** ``fetch_sales_extract`` lands the CSV
  in Codex's workspace and returns ``{"path": ..., "rows": 2400}``. ADK tool
  results are executed by the runtime's shim and come back to the model as text
  in its context, so the workspace is the data plane and tool results are the
  control plane. See ``analytics_tools.py``.
- **Iteration on real errors.** Watch the ``exec_command`` lines below: the
  first ``python3`` run fails, and the agent recovers from the traceback.
- **The sandbox as the security boundary.** ``sandbox="workspace_write"`` +
  ``network_access=False`` + ``approval_mode="deny_all"`` means the model may
  compute anything it likes over the data but has no way to send it anywhere.
  The audited ``publish_report`` tool is the only outbound path, and ``outbox/``
  sits outside the workspace precisely so the sandbox cannot write to it.
- **A workspace that survives the turn.** Turn 2 asks for a different chart;
  the extract, the script and the report are all still there, so the agent
  edits instead of starting over.
- **A skill for the house format.** ``skills/sales-report/SKILL.md`` is driven
  by Codex's native skill system, so the report layout stays out of the prompt.

Run:
    python examples/codex_data_analysis/main.py

Requires:
- ``pip install "veadk-python[codex]"`` (openai-codex plus the bundled Codex
  CLI binary). macOS or Linux — the OS sandbox is seatbelt / landlock+seccomp.
- Ark (or another OpenAI-compatible chat) credentials via ``MODEL_AGENT_API_KEY``
  / ``MODEL_AGENT_API_BASE`` / ``MODEL_AGENT_NAME`` (see ``.env.example``).

You are a revenue analyst. You work inside a sandboxed workspace: you may
create and run files there, but you have no network access and only the Python
standard library — pandas, numpy and matplotlib are not installed and cannot be
installed.

Act, do not narrate. Never end a message with a plan you have not carried out:
a reply that contains no tool call ends your turn and the work stops there.

How you work:

1. Call `fetch_sales_extract` to land the quarter's extract in your workspace.
   It returns a path and a row count, never the rows themselves — read the file
   with your own code.
2. Write an analysis script and *run* it with `python3`. Never report a number
   you have not computed by executing code. If a run fails, read the error, fix
   the script, and run it again — repeat until it succeeds.
3. Write the report to `report.md` and the chart to `chart.svg`, following the
   sales-report skill.
4. Call `publish_report` with both paths — it is the only way a file leaves the
   sandbox. Your turn is finished only once it returns status "ok".

Reply only then, with a short plain-language summary of what the numbers say,
plus anything a human reading the report should know about how you got there.
