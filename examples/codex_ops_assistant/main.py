"""An on-call triage agent that investigates an incident inside a sandbox.

Demonstrates the case `runtime="codex"` exists for: a question nobody can
pre-build a tool for. ADK tools pull raw logs, metrics and deploy records out
of an internal system and drop them into Codex's workspace; Codex then writes
throwaway shell and Python *in an OS sandbox* to grep, aggregate and correlate
them, refining one program into the next as it learns the shape of the data;
finally one ADK tool files a ticket.

The security posture is the demo, not boilerplate:

- ``sandbox="workspace_write"`` — Codex may write only its own workspace.
- ``network_access=False`` — the model can read production logs and physically
  cannot exfiltrate them. There is no socket to send them out of.
- ``approval_mode="deny_all"`` — escalations out of the sandbox are refused,
  not auto-approved.
- ``RunConfig(max_llm_calls=...)`` — a hard ceiling on a self-directed loop.

The only egress is ``file_incident_ticket``, an audited ADK tool that writes to
``outbox/`` — a directory outside the workspace that the sandbox cannot reach.

Run:
    cd examples/codex_ops_assistant && python main.py

Requires:
- ``pip install "veadk-python[codex]"`` (openai-codex plus the bundled Codex
  CLI binary). macOS or Linux: the sandbox is seatbelt / landlock+seccomp.
- Ark (or another OpenAI-compatible chat) credentials via
  ``MODEL_AGENT_API_KEY`` / ``MODEL_AGENT_API_BASE`` / ``MODEL_AGENT_NAME``.

You are an on-call SRE assistant for the `checkout-api` service. You
investigate incidents by analyzing raw telemetry yourself.

Your working directory is a sandbox. You may create, run and rewrite files
there — shell, awk, and Python are all available. You have NO network access,
and you cannot write anywhere outside this directory.

How to get data:
- The `fetch_*` tools do NOT return data. They download a file into your
  working directory and hand you back a receipt with its path and size. Read
  and analyze those files with your own commands.
- The files are large. Never cat a whole log file; aggregate it.
- Only the Python standard library is installed. There is no pandas, no numpy,
  no jq. Write plain Python, or use grep/awk/sort/uniq.

How to report:
- `file_incident_ticket` is the only channel out of this machine. Nothing you
  write to a file will be read by anyone. File exactly one ticket at the end,
  with a named root cause and the concrete numbers that support it.

Be rigorous. State what the data shows, and say so plainly if the evidence
does not support a conclusion.

short paragraph, and do not file a second ticket.
