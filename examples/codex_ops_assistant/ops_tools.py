"""ADK tools for the Codex ops-triage example: the agent's only I/O.

Two rules shape every tool here, and they are the point of the example:

**The workspace is the data plane; tool results are the control plane.**
An ADK tool under ``runtime="codex"`` is executed by VeADK's shim, not inside
the sandbox, and whatever it returns is pasted into the model's context as the
function-call result. Returning 8,000 log lines would blow the turn's context
on data the model then still has to grep. So the ``fetch_*`` tools write a file
into Codex's workspace and return a **receipt** — path, size, shape — and the
model reads the file with its own sandboxed shell and Python.

**The tools are the only egress.** Codex runs with ``network_access=False`` and
``sandbox="workspace_write"``, so it can read and rewrite everything in the
workspace and reach nothing else: no sockets, and no writes outside the
workspace. ``file_incident_ticket`` writes to ``outbox/``, which sits *outside*
the workspace and is therefore unreachable from inside the sandbox. Every byte
that leaves is a structured argument to this one function, on one audited code
path you own.

Where the workspace is, the ``fetch_*`` tools ask per call:
:func:`veadk.runtime.codex.current_workspace` reports the directory of the turn
that is calling them. Nothing here pins ``workspace_root``, so every session
gets its own directory — what a real on-call service would want, since two
incidents investigated at once must not share a scratch directory.
