"""Manual smoke test for a real local Pi binary.

This file is intentionally skipped by default because it calls a real model. Run
it explicitly after setting model credentials. Set PIAGENT_BINARY to use an
existing Pi executable inside a fully extracted Pi release directory; otherwise
the runtime uses PIAGENT_INSTALL_DIR/pi/pi and downloads Pi there when it is
missing:

    PIAGENT_BINARY=/path/to/pi \
    PIAGENT_AGENT_DIR=/private/tmp/veadk-piagent-test-home \
    MODEL_AGENT_API_KEY=<key> \
    PIAGENT_SMOKE_MODEL=<model> \
    PIAGENT_RUN_SMOKE=1 \
    .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/runtime/piagent/test_piagent_runtime_smoke.py -s

# NOTE: `pytest_configure` is only collected from `conftest.py` and plugins, so

# in `pytest.ini` instead. (It previously appeared to work only because
# `filterwarnings = ignore::UserWarning` swallowed the resulting
# `PytestUnknownMarkWarning`.)
