"""End-to-end contract tests for one Codex turn, driven through the real runtime.

The shim-level file next door (``test_codex_shim_rounds.py``) can express what
one HTTP request does, but not what the *runtime* guarantees across a whole
invocation. Everything here therefore runs ``CodexRuntime.run_async`` against
the differential suite's offline doubles -- the fake Codex SDK drives the real
shim over ``httpx.ASGITransport``, and a scripted backend stands in for the
model -- so no assertion here can be satisfied by a hand-built request body.

That matters most for :func:`test_agent_turn_still_gets_tools_and_replay`, the
paired positive for the compaction-isolation tests: whatever marks a request as
"the agent's own turn", this test gets it the way production does.
