"""Contract tests for the ``veadk.Agent`` public field surface.

``Agent`` is a pydantic model whose fields are its public configuration API
(used directly by callers and by the Harness server / web studio codegen). These
tests pin the veadk-specific fields and their defaults. They intentionally do
*not* assert the full field set — that includes inherited google-adk
``LlmAgent`` fields, which would make the test brittle against ADK upgrades.
