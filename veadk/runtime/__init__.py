"""Pluggable agent runtimes for VeADK.

``Agent(runtime=...)`` selects which runtime drives the inner agent loop:

- ``"adk"`` (default): Google ADK's built-in ``BaseLlmFlow`` (handled directly in
  :class:`veadk.agent.Agent`, no runtime object).
- ``"codex"``: the OpenAI Codex SDK as the agent harness.
- ``"piagent"``: a local Pi coding agent binary as the agent harness.
