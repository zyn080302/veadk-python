"""Support matrix for non-``adk`` agent runtimes.

``Agent(runtime="codex")`` and ``Agent(runtime="piagent")`` replace the *entire*
ADK LLM flow with an external harness. Everything ADK implements inside that
flow — agent transfer, request/response processors, the ``LlmRequest``
assembly, per-call callbacks — therefore does not run. Without a check, a large
part of :class:`veadk.agent.Agent`'s configuration surface is accepted at
construction time and then silently ignored at run time.

This module is the single, runtime-agnostic place that states which
configuration is unsupported and how loudly to say so:

* ``"error"`` — the configuration produces a *wrong answer* (not just a missing
  feature), so the agent must not run at all. Raised as :class:`ValueError`.
* ``"warn"`` — the configuration is dropped but the turn still produces a
  reasonable answer. Logged once per ``(agent identity, field)`` so a
  per-request cloned agent does not spam the log.

Rules read agent state defensively, so a duck-typed stand-in that happens not to
carry a field simply fires no rule. That keeps the checker usable from
:meth:`veadk.agent.Agent._run_async_impl` without constraining what the runtime
tests may pass directly into ``Runtime.run_async``.

Deliberately *not* covered: ``context_cache_config`` and ``parallel_worker``.
Neither is read by veadk or google-adk 2.2.0 on the ``adk`` path either, so
blaming the runtime for ignoring them would be wrong.
