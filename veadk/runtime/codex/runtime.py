"""OpenAI Codex runtime for VeADK.

Drives an agent invocation through the Codex SDK (``codex_app_server``) instead
of ADK's built-in LLM flow, while the surrounding ``Runner`` keeps owning
session, memory and tracing.

Key guarantees (mirroring the ``cc`` runtime):

- The model is always the one configured on the agent (or via ``ANTHROPIC_MODEL`` /
  settings); if none resolves, the runtime fails fast.
- Codex is isolated from the host's ``~/.codex`` via a dedicated ``CODEX_HOME`` with
  a generated ``config.toml``; the backend credential is injected through the
  provider's ``env_key`` env var. A wrong key fails loudly.
- Codex only speaks the Responses API, so requests are routed through an
  in-process Responses→chat shim (see :mod:`veadk.runtime.codex.proxy`).

Note: this requires the ``openai-codex`` SDK (``pip install openai-codex``),
which bundles the Codex CLI binary via its ``openai-codex-cli-bin`` dependency.
