"""OpenAI Responses shim with live streaming and shim-owned ADK tools.

Codex speaks the Responses API. Streaming requests go to the configured
OpenAI-compatible Responses endpoint through a request-scoped protocol client;
this avoids LiteLLM buffering unregistered provider model names. Non-streaming
requests retain the LiteLLM adapter. Codex connects only to the local shim.

The agent's ADK tools are deliberately *not* exposed to Codex: they are
advertised to the backend as plain ``function`` tools and executed by the shim
itself in a bounded internal loop (see :class:`TurnToolState`). Codex never sees
them, so the shim — not Codex — owns their conversation history.

    ``get_shim`` returns well before the caller can ``register_turn``: the Codex

    in a worker thread), prepares a ``CODEX_HOME``, syncs skills, and
    builds/resumes its toolsets (which connects MCP servers). Across that whole
    window the shim has no registered turn, so a concurrent ``get_shim`` for a
    different backend could evict it — stopping its server and releasing its
    port — and the turn would then register on a corpse and point Codex at a
    dead URL for its entire duration.

    This value alone cannot close that window, because the window has no bound
    the shim can know: MCP connect timeouts and workspace reaping are the
    caller's business, and any constant is a guess that a slow setup outlives.
    What actually holds the reservation open is the :class:`ShimLease`
    ``get_shim`` returns — the shim keeps only a weak reference to it, so the
    reservation lives exactly as long as the caller's own reference does, for
    any setup duration. This deadline is the *floor* underneath that, for a
    caller that keeps only the URL and drops the lease (:func:`get_shim_url`)
    or that never held one at all.

    Neither half is a caller-released counter, and that is deliberate: a release
    call would have to survive every exit path of an async generator (including
    a consumer abandoning it mid-setup), and one missed release would pin a shim
    in the cache forever. Dropping the last reference to a lease is not a call
    that can be missed — the interpreter always makes it, on every exit path —
    and :meth:`register_turn` consumes the reservation atomically with inserting
    the turn, so the normal path never waits for the floor to expire.

        Codex reuses one provider block — and therefore one bearer token — for
        work that is *not* the agent turn: auto/manual compaction
        (``codex-rs/core/src/compact.rs::run_compact_task_inner_impl``, which
        re-sends the whole history plus a summarization instruction with an
        empty ``tools`` list) and code review (``session/review.rs``, which
        clones the parent turn's provider into a *fresh* delegate thread). If
        the shim advertised the agent's ADK tools to those passes, or replayed
        the turn's tool transcript into them, the summarizer could emit a
        ``function_call`` and the shim would execute a real tool a second time.

        Identification is positive, never by exclusion:

        * **Marker path** (production). The runtime embeds this turn's
          ``turn_marker`` in the Codex prompt, so the marker travels in the
          turn's own user message. Compaction *preserves* that message — it
          re-sends the full history — so the marker alone is not enough; the
          request must additionally look like a *sampling* pass rather than a
          summarization one. Two independent signals say so, and either
          suffices: the marker is in the **last** user message (compaction
          appends its instruction after it, so this is false there), or the
          request advertises a non-empty ``tools`` list (compaction always
          sends ``[]``; this is the arm that keeps ADK tools working for the
          rest of a turn *after* a mid-turn compaction has appended its summary
          as a trailing user message).
        * **Anchor path** (fallback). If the marker never arrives on the first
          request — an SDK or Codex version that reshapes the prompt — the shim
          degrades to matching the first request's user-message texts instead of
          failing the turn's tools closed for good. The first request under a
          freshly registered token is by construction the turn's opening
          sampling request: nothing exists yet to compact and no review thread
          can have been spawned. Later requests are then held to the same
          two-signal test as the marker path, because a compaction pass re-sends
          the whole history and so always carries the anchor texts.

        Residual risk, stated rather than hidden: both paths lean on compaction
        sending an empty ``tools`` list. A Codex version that advertises tools
        on a summarization pass would satisfy the ``tools_advertised`` arm and
        be treated as the agent turn. That arm cannot simply be dropped — it is
        what keeps ADK tools working for the rest of a turn after a mid-turn
        compaction appends its summary as a trailing user message.

        Returns:
            bool: ``True`` when tool injection, transcript replay and the

    *liveness*. The shim holds only a weak reference back, so the reservation

    That is deliberately not a release call: there is nothing to call, so there
    is nothing to miss on an exception, a ``GeneratorExit``, or a consumer that
    abandons the runtime's async generator mid-setup — the interpreter drops the
