"""OpenAI Codex SDK runtime.

The implementation is imported lazily so configuration, translation, and tool
bridge helpers remain usable when the optional ``openai-codex`` SDK is absent.

:func:`current_workspace` is deliberately *not* lazy: an ADK tool imports it to
find the directory the sandbox is working in, and that tool module has to stay
importable in processes where the Codex SDK is not installed (the same tool is
routinely run by other runtimes, and by unit tests).
