# VeADK Harness Extension

[中文](README.zh.md)

`veadk.extensions.harness` exposes two mutually exclusive integration modes.
The legacy in-process mode adds three reusable capabilities:

- context preparation for each agent turn
- tool-result compaction
- answer verification and hallucination suppression

The legacy extension can be used directly as Python modules or attached to a
VeADK Runner. It does not require a separate runtime service.

Managed Sidecar mode is different: all Harness behavior runs in the private
Sidecar Runtime. `HarnessExtension.from_env()` only starts that Runtime, applies
its model/MCP bindings, and owns its lifecycle. In this mode `plugins()` always
returns an empty list and no `veadk.extensions.harness.plugins` implementation is
loaded or attached to the application process. Do not combine the two modes.

## Install

```bash
pip install "veadk-python[harness]"
```

The base extension is bundled with VeADK. The `harness` extra installs the
optional in-process Headroom compaction provider.

For local development inside this repository:

```bash
pip install .
```

For local development with Headroom:

```bash
pip install ".[harness]"
```

## Quick Start

```python
from veadk.extensions.harness.plugins import build_harness_plugins
from veadk import Agent, Runner

agent = Agent(name="research_agent")
runner = Runner(
    agent=agent,
    app_name="research",
    plugins=build_harness_plugins(
        components=["invocation_context", "compactor", "response_verification"],
        profile="research",
    ),
)
```

## Plugins

| Plugin | Main hooks | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HarnessInvocationContextPlugin` | `on_user_message_callback`, `before_model_callback` | Prepares task anchors, recent context, and tool-use guardrails. |
| `HarnessCompressPlugin` | `before_model_callback`, `after_tool_callback` | Shrinks oversized tool outputs while preserving useful facts. |
| `HarnessResponseVerificationPlugin` | `after_tool_callback`, `after_model_callback`, `on_event_callback` | Records tool receipts and flags unsupported final claims. |

## Runtime Environment

```text
HARNESS_ENHANCE_ENABLED=true
HARNESS_ENHANCE_COMPONENTS=invocation_context,compactor,response_verification
HARNESS_PROFILE=research
HARNESS_COMPRESSION_PROVIDER=builtin
```

```python
from veadk.extensions.harness.env import build_harness_plugins_from_env

plugins = build_harness_plugins_from_env()
```

With VeADK HarnessApp deployment, the same settings can be written in
`harness.yaml`:

```yaml
harness_enhance:
  enabled: true
  components: [invocation_context, compactor, response_verification]
  profile: general
  compression_provider: builtin
```

## Direct Module Usage

```python
from veadk.extensions.harness import HarnessInvocationContextBuilder, HarnessInvocationRef

context = HarnessInvocationRef(session_id="session-1", invocation_id="run-1")
builder = HarnessInvocationContextBuilder()
bundle = builder.prepare_context(context, user_input="Summarize these tool results.")
```
