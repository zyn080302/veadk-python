    This agent is capable of executing multiple sub-agents concurrently, making it suitable
    for scenarios that require parallel execution of multiple tasks or operations. By leveraging
    parallelism, the agent can handle more complex workflows and improve efficiency by performing
    independent tasks simultaneously. This design is ideal for scenarios where tasks are independent
    and can benefit from reduced execution time.

    Attributes:
        model_config (ConfigDict): Configuration dictionary for the model.
        name (str): The name of the agent, default is "veParallelAgent".
        description (str): A description of the agent, useful in A2A scenarios.
        instruction (str): Instructions or principles for function calling and agent execution.
        sub_agents (list[BaseAgent]): A list of sub-agents managed by the parallel agent.
            Each sub-agent is executed concurrently.
        tracers (list[BaseTracer]): A list of tracers used for monitoring the agent's performance
            and behavior during parallel execution.
