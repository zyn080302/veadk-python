    ExtractorResponse encapsulates the output from attribute extraction functions
    and provides metadata about how the extracted data should be applied to
    OpenTelemetry spans. It supports different response types for flexible
    span annotation patterns.

    The response system enables extractors to return various data formats
    including simple attributes, structured events, and event collections,
    allowing for rich telemetry data capture and organization.

    Attributes:
        content: The extracted data to be applied to the span. Can be any type
            depending on the response type and extractor implementation.
        type: Specification of how the content should be applied to spans.
            Controls the span annotation method used.

    Response Types:
        - "attribute": Sets span attributes using set_attribute()
        - "event": Adds span events using add_event()
        - "event_list": Adds multiple events from a structured list
